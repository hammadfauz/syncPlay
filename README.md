syncPlay
========
A Nodejs-based app for playing local videos in-sync, in the browser. Dedicated to my fiance, for watching movies and tv-series with her. ;)

How to set up
=============
- Set up Node.js
- Get the code
- In the code directory, run: ```node index.js```
- Open (modern) Browser. (Must support html5 video, and websockets)
- Go to ```http://your-ip:8000/player.html```
  * You can change the port from the code.
- Choose a file from your hard-disk
- Ask the friend to do steps 4-6 on their PC
- Repeat step 7 for all the friends you plan to watch a movie with
- Watch the movie together
  * Pressing play on either browser (yours or friend's) plays the movie on both/all browsers
  * Pressing pause, pauses the movie for both/all
  * Seeeking to a new position, also seeks to same time in both/all clients
  * Volume controls are independant
- Popcorn sharing is not supported. ;)
